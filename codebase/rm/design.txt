Table data is stored stored in heap files.

- Each page in the heap is 4096 bytes (4KB) in size.

- A page is either:
  * a control page
  * a data page

- The space needed to address a page is 12 bits. When convenient we use
  2 bytes instead.

Control Pages:

- A control page tells us the amount of unused space in a data page.

- The format for a control page is as follows:
  (free_0, free_1, free_2, ..., free_k, ..., next_control_pid)

  * next_control_pid is an unsigned 32-bit int, stored at offset 4092
    in the page. It indicates the next control page, page id.

- For example, to find the amount of unused space for page 20.
  Calculate the bit offset:            20*12 = 240.
  Find the byte offset:                240 / 8 = 30
  Find the bit offset:                 240 % 8 = 0
  Find the amount of unused space:     unsigned short x = (page[30] << 4) | (page[31] >> 4)
